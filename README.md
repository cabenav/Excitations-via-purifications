# Excitations-via-purifications
This is the code of the paper "Excitations of quantum many-body systems via purified ensembles" https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10974

The main code is wfield.py. This code diagonalizes the Fermi-Hubbard model with L number of sites in the entire Fock space, i.e. N = 0,1,2,...,L-1,L. 
Since L is the number of sites this is the main variable of the code.
